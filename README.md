# RenewableEnergyCalculator

A project that will help users determine if investing into wind turbines or solar panels will be a net positive for their household energy consumption. It analazys wind speeds and sunshine data to calculate potential energy generation and compares it with users energy consumption.

The app retrieves real-time meteorological data either from the Meteostat API or directly from the user, and then uses that data to perform the calculations.

## Features
- Wind energy estimation
- Solar energy estimation
- Energy consumption comparison
- User or API input
- Interface in a form of web app

## Tech
- Python
- Django - web framework
- Meteostat package - for gathering data
- HTML/CSS/JS
